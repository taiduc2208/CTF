pep8 - Python style guide checker
pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions
in PEP 8.

Features
Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.
Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.
Small: Just one Python file, requires only stdlib. You can use just the pep8.py file for this purpose.
Comes with a comprehensive test suite.


Installation
You can install, upgrade, uninstall pep8.py with these commands:

$ pip install pep8
$ pip install --upgrade pep8
$ pip uninstall pep8



There’s also a package for Debian/Ubuntu, but it’s not always the
latest version.

Example usage and output
$ pep8 --first optparse.py

and even the relevant text from PEP 8:
